# Project Summary

## Part A: Data Collection

- **Custom Python + Playwright Scraper:**  
  Easily configurable via YAML for B2B marketplaces (IndiaMART, Alibaba, TradeIndia, etc.).
- **Modular and Maintainable:**  
  Clear separation into config loading, extraction, deduplication, and navigation functions.
- **Persistent Deduplication:**  
  Prevents duplicate scrapes by storing product links across runs.
- **Output:**  
  Generates clean, structured Parquet files including product, company, specs, and category information.

## Part B: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Automated Cleaning:**  
  Deduplication, column standardization, type conversion, feature engineering, and missing data handling via `transform.py`.
- **Comprehensive EDA:**  
  Includes product/brand/category counts, price distributions, frequent keywords, regional supplier insights, and data quality checks.
- **Sample Visualizations:**  
  - Top brands (bar chart)
  - Price ranges (histogram)
  - Product categories (pie chart)
  - Supplier locations (bar chart)
- **Ready for Analytics:**  
  Transformed data saved as Parquet for further analysis.

## Key Insights (Sample)

- **Top Categories:** Industrial Machinery, Electronics, Textiles
- **Frequent Brands:** ‘Unknown’ (data gap), LG, Samsung
- **Price Ranges:** Electronics ₹500–₹2,500; Machinery ₹10,000–₹1,00,000
- **Regional Hotspots:** Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore
- **Data Gaps:** ~10% missing prices, ~40% missing brands

## Opportunities for Cloud & Production Enhancement

- **Scalable Processing:**  
  Use Dask or Spark in place of pandas for handling large-scale data.
- **Cloud Storage:**  
  Save Parquet outputs directly to Amazon S3 or similar object storage for durability and sharing.
- **Business Intelligence Integration:**  
  Connect S3 data with Tableau, Looker, or similar BI tools for live dashboards.
- **Serverless Analytics:**  
  Use DuckDB to stream and analyze Parquet files directly from S3 for fast, low-cost analytics.
- **Workflow Automation:**  
  Schedule and monitor ETL with Airflow or Prefect for continuous data updates.
